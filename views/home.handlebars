                            <p>Innovation comes from understanding why a user starts a job and how they complete it. Using The Job to be Done Framework uncovers pockets of innovation in existing tasks, but also leads to new products and services which typically solve pain points in complete tasks. This is done by focusing on the why and how rather than the who is doing the job (a persona approach).</p>
                            <p>Applying this framework to CX development in financial services requires deep engagement with customers and markets. Building a bank for freelancers? Spend two days with freelancers to understand where they are spending excessive time on a task. Building a bank for expats? Identify the non-banking challenges associated with relocation and look to create a complementary digital service to your mobile app.</p>

                            The rise of fintechs, open API adoption and a greater propensity to collaborate across sectors has created an environment where fast and new  product and service development is becoming standard within financial services. On the other hand, product, strategy and innovation teams are faced with pressure to replicate success in other markets and are flooded with ideas and opportunities.
