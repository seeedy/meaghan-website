                    <div class="principles-number">1.</div>

                        </div>
                        <div class="principles-text-1">
                            <p>Using The Job to be Done Framework uncovers pockets of innovation in existing tasks, but also leads to new products and services which typically solve pain points in complete tasks. This is done by focusing on the why and how rather than the who is doing the job (a persona approach).</p>
                            <p>Applying this framework to CX development in financial services requires deep engagement with customers and markets. To understand gaps in the freelancing market, study the life of a freelancer for two days to understand where time is wasted. Looking to launch a bank account focused on expats coming to Germany? Understand the challenges with registering and finding a flat to create a complementary service with your banking product to capture market share.</p>

                            <p>Understanding cultural nuances, for example how likely are customers to re-sell goods on platforms such as Shpock, how important is traveling for millenials, or if cash is still king (or queen), can serve as key factors in creating relevant customer experiences.
                            The rise of fintechs, open API adoption and a greater propensity to collaborate across sectors has created an environment where fast and new  product and service development is becoming standard within financial services. On the other hand, product, strategy and innovation teams are faced with pressure to replicate success in other markets and are flooded with ideas and opportunities.
